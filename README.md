# PMF Testing Library

## About
This is a very simple javascript library for testing Probability Mass Funcitons and their behavior.
There are some known function that comes out the box.  You can also write your own functions.

## Notes
Each PMF function must return a float number between 0 and 1.  This number represents an occurrence of this function and the probability of occurence of that number depends extrictly on the expressed function.
